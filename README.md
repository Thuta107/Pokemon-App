# **Pokemon App**
This is my own personal project for the simple and small pokemon database using the PokeAPI. The project allows you to lookup on the data of various pokemon & pokemon moves available throughout different generations of the pokemon game. Followings are some of the features that I want
to add on in the future.
- Team Building
- Battle Simulation (data available from current PokeAPI alone may not be sufficient to support this feature)
